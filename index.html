<h1>Java Notes</h1>

<p>
  Object-oriented programming revolves around classes and objects. The class is a fundamental concept of OOP
  and programs in Java are built with multiple classes and their objects.

<!-- 
public class Car {
  String color;
  boolean isRunning;
  int velocity;

  public Car(String carColor, boolean carRunning, int milesPerHour) {
    color = carColor;
    isRunning = carRunning;
    velocity = milesPerHour;
  }
}

public class Main() {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car ferrari = new Car{"red", true, 27);
    Car renault = new Car("blue", false, 70);

    System.out.println(renault.isRunning);
    System.out.println(ferrari.velocity);
  }
}

Car honda = new Car("green", false, 0);
Car junker = new Car(true, 42, "brown");
